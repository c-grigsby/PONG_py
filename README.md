This desktop application replicates the legendary Pong arcade game. Interestingly, there was no code in the original PONG. In fact, it used no CPU or game code software at all. It was made using pure physical electronics by Atari in 1972 (see below)

## About PONG

Pong was one of the first computer games ever created. This simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal being to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain 10 points. A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.
